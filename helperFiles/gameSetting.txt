Setting 1:

As you tredge towards the abandoned castle in the distance, you prepare youself for the challenges you must face inside. Once a mercenary, you were caught and tried by the local government. To
buy your freedom you have been tasked with clearing out an abandoned castle. The townspeople have sent you on this mission believing it to be impossible, as the castle was overrun 14 years ago
by a horde of monsters, killing anyone in the castle. You must prove them wrong if you are to earn your freedom.

Setting 2:

It is your duty as the newest captain of the local army to clear out the treacherous beasts that have inhabited your town's once noble castle. What was once a symbol of wealth and prosperity has
become a hunting ground for monsters and a target for any thief daring enough to break in and steal what wealth remains in the castle. Perhaps if you free the town from this blight you will
be promoted to the general of the army, and one day you might reclaim your family's throne.

Setting 3:

For some thieves, crime is the only way for them to feed themselves and survive in this unforgiving world. But all you care about is the adrenaline rush you get when stealing some rich fool's
money. After you robbed most of the previous town's upper class, you found yourself in Havenwood, a town once known for its magnificent displays of wealth and breatiful architecture. When you 
arrive there however, the town is in a state of disarray, with many people leaving by the day, and the noblemen attempting to lay claim to whatever wealth there is remaining. The cause? A 
fortress, stormed by monsters and completely abandoned. Robbing humans has gotten stale, but robbing from monsters? There can be no greater thrill.
